# hello-hike
My first repo from Hike.

Nothing to look here. Shoo.

Okay, fine. I am the newest intern at Hike, and it's been a wonderful journey so far. I'm so glad to be working here, and I hope to spend some quality time contributing and learning about the newer things in the market of Hikers. Oh, that's what we're called - Hikers! Because, well, we keep climbing the app market. (not just that, also the stairs of your heart)

Yup. Got that right. Die hard fan of Hike. Why? My love is there. That's why.

Okay, peace. Cya. <3
